###FEATURES
Add all players before starting the game. This can be done via the "add" button or the enter key on the keyboard.

Once all players have been added, click "Start Game"

The player whose turn it is will have their name highlighted in green. Add their score to the input, which only accepts numbers,
and hit the enter key. Then to move to the next player, either use the right arrow key or the "Next Player" button.

If you need to go back the the previous player for any reason, use the left arrow key or the "Previous Player" button.

NOTE! Be careful not to change the player when using the arrow keys to fix a mistake in the entered score. Make sure that the
correct player is highlighted when you hit enter. If a mistake is made, you can add a negative number to said player's score
to revert it.
